        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fill up at breakfast time with this healthy low-sugar granola, served with your choice of milk and sliced fresh strawberries. It'll keep you going until lunch.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>200g Rolled Oats</li>
            <li>150g Bag Mixed Nuts</li>
            <li>150g Mixed Seeds</li>
            <li>1 Orange, Zested</li>
            <li>2 Tsp Mixed Spice</li>
            <li>2 Tsp Cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Cold Pressed Rapeseed Oil</li>
            <li>1½ Tbsp Maple Syrup</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 4. Mix all the ingredients in a bowl with a pinch of salt, then spread out on a baking tray.</li>
            <li>Roast for 30-35 mins until golden, pulling the tray out of the oven twice while cooking to give everything a good stir – this will help the granola toast evenly. Leave to cool. Will keep in an airtight container for one month.</li>
        </ol>
